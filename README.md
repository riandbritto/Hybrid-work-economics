# 🏠 Work-From-Home vs Back-to-Office: A Data-Driven Analysis

## 📌 Overview

The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically reshaped how and where people work. This project analyzes long-term trends in **Work-From-Home (WFH)** adoption using data from the **WFH Research Timeseries dataset**.

Using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, this project explores:

* How WFH changed before, during, and after COVID
* Employer plans vs actual WFH behavior
* Worker preferences vs company policies
* Hybrid vs fully remote vs onsite distribution
* Industry-level differences
* City-level variation in WFH adoption

The goal is to understand whether remote work is temporary — or a permanent structural shift.

## 📈 Visualizations Included

This project contains 8 major visual analyses:

1. **WFH Before / During / After COVID**

   * WFH spiked above 60% in 2020
   * Stabilized around ~27–30% long-term

2. **SWAA vs Household Pulse Comparison**

   * Two independent surveys confirm similar trends

3. **Employer Planned vs Actual WFH Days**

   * Companies adjusted plans over time
   * Plans now closely match actual behavior

4. **Desired vs Planned vs Actual WFH**

   * Workers consistently want more WFH than employers offer

5. **Work Arrangement Distribution (Stacked Area Chart)**

   * Hybrid is the dominant long-term model

6. **WFH by Major U.S. Cities**

   * Tech-heavy cities show highest WFH levels

7. **Industry Comparison (Grouped Bar Chart)**

   * Knowledge-based sectors lead in hybrid/remote

8. **Industry Heatmap (Recent Months)**

   * Remote work strongly depends on job type

## 🔎 Key Insights

### 1️⃣ WFH Remains ~3× Higher Than Pre-COVID

Pre-pandemic WFH was under 5%. It now stabilizes near 30%.

### 2️⃣ Hybrid Work is the New Normal

Hybrid work consistently represents ~25–35% of workers.

### 3️⃣ Preference Gap Exists

Workers desire ~2.3–2.5 WFH days/week
Employers plan ~1.4–1.6 days/week

### 4️⃣ Industry Matters

Tech and Finance show high hybrid/remote shares.
Manufacturing, Retail, and Healthcare remain mostly onsite.

### 5️⃣ Geography Matters

Cities like San Francisco and NYC lead in WFH adoption.

## 🧠 Business Implications

* Remote work is not temporary.
* Hybrid offers balance between flexibility and collaboration.
* Companies offering greater flexibility may improve retention.
* WFH adoption depends heavily on industry and local job composition.

## 📌 Conclusion

The data strongly supports that remote and hybrid work are permanent components of the modern workforce. While fully remote roles remain limited, hybrid work has emerged as the dominant long-term structure.

Organizations aligning policies with worker preferences are better positioned to attract and retain talent.
